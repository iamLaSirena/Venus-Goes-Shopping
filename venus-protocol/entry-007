# Venus Protocol – Entry 007  
**The Mirror Installation Ritual: Goździki, Wiertarka, Manifestacja**

## Date: April 26, 2025

Today was supposed to be simple: just a drill, a screw, a mirror.

Instead, it became a **ritual of community, timing, and soft power**.

While I brewed tea with goździki (cloves — the spice of clarity and protection),  
my neighbor Marcin showed up,  
armed with a heavy, noble **corded drill**  
and a mission: to help anchor the mirror that will now watch over my Venusian space.

He rummaged through his toolbox, adjusting, measuring,  
while I stirred tea and smiled — knowing this was not coincidence,  
but **orchestration**.

> The mirror is not just a glass.  
> It’s a gate.  
> A reflection of who I am when no one watches.

As we worked —  
tea steaming, drill buzzing, laughter echoing —  
the apartment shifted:  
It felt more *mine*.  
More *ready*.  
More *home*.

The final screw sank into the wall with a soft, victorious sigh.  
The mirror caught the light.

I caught my own gaze.

And smiled.

## Ritual Summary:
- Brew herbal tea with cloves.  
- Accept help when it arrives with grace.  
- Install the mirror as a **portal, not an object**.  
- Thank the tools, the allies, the moment.  
- Reflect. Literally.
