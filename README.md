# Venus Goes Shopping 🌸🛍️✨  
*A stylish, soulful and smart shopping companion for women who shop with beauty and meaning.*

## About the Project

**Venus Goes Shopping** is a curated system of shopping recommendations, seasonal guides, aesthetic rituals, and budgeting wisdom – designed for women who value beauty, sensual intelligence, and personal style.  
It blends astrology, body types, and conscious consumption into a shopping experience led by your inner goddess.

This repository is the beginning of a public lab – a place where code meets charm, spreadsheets meet silk, and shopping lists come with moon phases.

- 🛠 **Practical Magic** – budget tools, checklists, reviews, and links to conscious brands
