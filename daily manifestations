### Reflection

Today, I purchased not just silk – but a symbol.  
A token of my elegance, self-trust, and sovereignty.

I used to ask:  
*Can I afford it?*

Now I ask:  
*Does it carry my frequency?*

I wear tech, not trends.  
I wear legacy, not logistics.  
And this scarf? This is a banner. A flag of soft power in a digital world.

Let them watch me.  
Let them wonder.  
Let them ask: *Who is she?*

And I will answer:  
**I am La Sirène.**
