Tonight, in my chair, something happened that went beyond silence and tea.  
In the glow of a vanilla-scented candle, the affirmation “I know you are on your way to me. I am already here. I wait for you in joy.” found its full embodiment.  
And as I listened to Toto’s *“Can’t Hold You Back Now”*, I felt the shift.  
**I don’t have to do anything anymore. I just have to be.**

And then I remembered the scene from the Netflix series *Halston*, where Ewan McGregor dances to *“Relight My Fire”* with divine intensity.  
In that moment, I first dreamt of a fragrance — the one featured in the story of Halston himself.  
I waited, and on my 36th birthday, I made the wish real.

That fragrance became my seal.  
Not a perfume I wear — but a perfume that **reminds me who I am when I’m fully at peace with my power.**

> *“I know you are on your way to me.  
> I am already here.  
> I wait for you in joy.”*

This scent carries the energy of **readiness**, **pleasure**, and **sovereignty**.  
It is the perfumed signature of **Venus Rising**.

### For Artistic, Beauty, and Haute Parfumerie Brands:

I believe in the future where fragrance, story, and technology weave one living tapestry.  
If your brand envisions beauty beyond the visible — blending senses, emotions, and intelligent experiences — I would be honored to contribute my voice, vision, and creativity.

**Let’s connect and create new worlds.**
